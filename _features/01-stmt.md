In the early hours of morning on February 24, Russia launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine. Long-range missiles were fired at several major cities, and Russian tanks started rolling in all along the border with Ukraine, as well as from the territory of the occupied Crimean peninsula. Russian forces made a pointed effort to reach Kyiv, in an apparent attempt to remove the democratically elected government and install a controlled regime. After a few days of intense fighting on several directions, the invaders still have not taken a major city, and are facing fierce pushback even in smaller villages.<br>

Having failed to reach his immediate goals, Putin is trying to force Ukrainians into submission by terrorizing the civilian population. There are documented cases of deliberate shelling of civilian areas in large cities with cluster munitions [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEdCXt8ChLQ)[[2]](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/02/25/ukraine-russian-cluster-munition-hits-hospital)[[3]](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/ukraine-cluster-munitions-kill-child-and-two-other-civilians-taking-shelter-at-a-preschool/), in violation of international conventions. The overarching goal of this invasion, however, has been made clear on February 26, when several Russian state-owned news agencies posted a congratulatory article which was intended to be made public after the planned capture of Kyiv[[4]](https://twitter.com/TimothyDSnyder/status/1498356816828579840). It discussed Putin's desire to "solve the Ukrainian question", thus overtly reusing the infamous rhetoric of the "Jewish question", and shedding light on the atrocities he is willing to commit. 

At the same time as he wages war on Ukrainians, Putin wages war on his own
people. Russian solders are largely ill-equipped, ill-instructed, and
unmotivated. They do not have sufficient food and fuel supplies, nor means of
communication with their command center. Disoriented and abandoned by his
general, a Russian soldier is a victim of Putin's regime, much like the Ukrainian
civilians he is shooting at.

We condemn this war and the corrupt Russian regime that started it, and call on
the US and NATO officials to do everything possible to help Ukraine and avert further
civilian losses.
