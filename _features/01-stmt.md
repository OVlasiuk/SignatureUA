As you read this, Ukrainian armed forces, together with ordinary citizens, keep beating the living hell out of what was claimed to be the most powerful army in Europe. In the past five days, Ukraine has proven that while it is definitely the target of the most atrocious and unprecedented aggression, it does not give up and continues to fight back.

The invaders aim, as they have bluntly stated themselves, "to solve the Ukrainian question", overtly reusing the infamous rhetoric of the "Jewish question". Their means are terroristic. Their words are filled with blatant lies and contradictions. They want to intimidate the world into obedience with mass murder and destruction, and then proclaim it all to be water under the bridge and realpolitik.

The price, in economic, industrial, and more importantly, human losses, that Ukraine has paid these days has already bought us the right to join the family of Western nations. But the war is not over, and its toll is mounting with every passing day. 

What we need now is weapons to fight the war, which would otherwise be threatening Europe and the whole world. We need fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to protect our skies, satellite intelligence to locate Grad artillery systems shelling our cities and drone strikes to destroy them, Javelins and NLAWs to roast the tanks daring to invade Kyiv. We need everything, and every bit counts.

We need sanctions that will pierce through bloody business interests of Putin's oligarchs and through the consciousness of ordinary Russian people, who have been brainwashed with propaganda for years. These sanctions are just, and, more importantly, they are practical.

We need money and supplies; we need red tape lifted to quickly and effectively solve the daily, nay, hourly needs of our army and our people. And then the war will end; it will end with Ukraine's, and the world's, victory, which is now only flickering on the horizon. And after that, we will need a new Marshall plan for Ukraine. The US has tried it before. It works.

We are hereby calling on the Vanderbilt administration to acknowledge the ongoing war and condemn Russia's actions. The current official language from the university leadership refers to this bloody conflict as a
["situation"](https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2022/02/25/statement-from-chancellor-diermeier-on-events-in-ukraine-university-resources-available).
