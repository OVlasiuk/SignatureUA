In the early hours of morning on February 24, Russia launched a full-scale attack on Ukraine. Several major cities were shelled, and Russian tanks started rolling in all along the border with Ukraine, as well as from the territory of the occupied Crimean peninsula. Russian forces made a pointed effort to reach Kyiv, in an apparent attempt to remove the democratically elected government and install a controlled regime. After a few days of intense fighting on several directions, the invaders still have not taken a major city, and are facing fierce pushback even in smaller villages.<br>

Having failed to reach its immediate goals, Putin's Russia is trying to force Ukrainians into submission by terrorizing the civilian population. There are documented cases of deliberate shelling of civilian areas in large cities with cluster munitions [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEdCXt8ChLQ)[[2]](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/02/25/ukraine-russian-cluster-munition-hits-hospital)[[3]](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/ukraine-cluster-munitions-kill-child-and-two-other-civilians-taking-shelter-at-a-preschool/), in violation of international conventions. The overarching goal of this invasion, however, has been made clear on February 26, when several Russian state-owned news agencies posted a congratulatory article which was intended to be made public after the intended invasion of Kyiv[[4]](https://twitter.com/TimothyDSnyder/status/1498356816828579840). It discussed Putin's desire to "solve the Ukrainian question", thus overtly using the infamous rhetoric about the "Jewish question". Will the West watch from the sidelines as Putin's final solution is being applied to the Ukrainian people?
